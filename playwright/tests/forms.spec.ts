     * This test asserts that the data submitted by forms will not include corrupted files.
     * How does it work? We intercept PUT requests made to S3 pre-signed URLs using api mock
     * (axios-mock-adapter instance). In this middleware, we assert that the request's payload is an instance of
     * WebApi/File. If the data submitted by a form is malformed, the mocked endpoint will throw an exception making
     * the form submission and the test below to fail.
     *
     * Notes:
     * - in order for this to work, we have to assert that the form has been submitted correctly. e.g. check for a
     * submission confirmation message. For this, we need to make sure the form properly handles failed
     * uploads. e.g. displays an error message.
     * - we use FixRecords component here for the sake of simplicity. Should this form be removed in the future, please
     * refactor this test to use another form that has a field based on FileUploader component and uses
     * repositories/files::putUploadFile() for uploading files.
