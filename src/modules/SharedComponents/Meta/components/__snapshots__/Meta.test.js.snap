A main feature of the meeting was the direct interactions between a wide range of professionals and researchers working on a broad range of relevant topics, including operational issues, sediments and turbidity, mud rheology, H2S, and flow measurements. Another interesting aspect of this event was the stimulating debates during and after the presentations, as well as during the subsequent discussions and the field measurements. Contributions include: Challenges in Sewer Hydrodynamics, Sediments and Measurements, Sedimentation in Large Combined Sewage Systems: Perspectives of an Operator, A New Velocity and Total Suspended Solid Measurement Device, Measurements of Pollutants by Turbidimetry, Acoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) in the Field and in Laboratory: Practical Experiences, Sewer Sediments - their Diversity, Impact and Modelling Challenges, Use of CFD Techniques to Estimate the Spatial Distribution of Sediment on the Bed of a Large Detention and Settling Basin. The publication of the proceedings marked the successful conclusion of this event. Each paper was peer-reviewed by a minimum of two experts. A key feature of all these contributions is the practical knowledge gained in the last ten to fifteen years, and a particular effort was made by all contributors to share both positive and negative experiences.",

In the early 1930's Scandinavian functionalist architecture came to prominence and continued in popularity for a short period, dying out in the mid 1930's. The subject project involved the restoration of an existing timber functionalist house designed in 1933 by the architect Lidija Hofmane-Grinberga and constructed in the same year. The site also contained two outbuildings designed and constructed in the mid and late 1980's The project aimed to draw out the latent potential of the site circumstance that comprised the sunny garden hidden from the street and buildings that enclosed the garden to create an informal yet enclosed space that became in effect the major outdoor "room" of the house. The design draws inspiration from traditional Latvian farmhouse courtyard gardens, Japanese enclosed gardens as well as the work of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto.",

          "content": "It is undeniable that a good doctor-patient communication is essential and critical in providing an effective treatment to the patient. Many patients have difficulty in finding relevant words to communicate with their doctors especially if there is a language barrier. If patients use an English-Chinese medical dictionary, they have to search the dictionary multiple times to find the relevant words and yet they still cannot find all the needed words and sentences to communicate with their doctors. Dictionary does not tell readers what the relevant and important points are and how to express them to their doctors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Kam Cheong Wong and Dr Zhiqiang Wang, from the Centre of Chronic Disease (School of Medicine, University of Queensland, Australia), published a journal paper in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health regarding the importance of using bilingual English-Chinese language in a health survey. The survey was conducted in Brisbane (Queensland, Australia) using a bilingual English-Chinese questionnaire. The survey found that two-third of the Chinese community preferred to use Chinese language in the health survey (please refer to the reference).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Health authorities in many countries such as Australia traditionally rely on provision of interpreter services to help doctors and patients in their day-to-day communication. Even so the interpreter cannot teach a patient what to say to his/her doctor. To improve the communication, governments have started to invest more in health education to empower people in disease prevention and health care access. Patients are encouraged to communicate with their doctors and become &amp;lsquo;partners&amp;rsquo; in disease management. Nevertheless, there is a missing link because of language barrier. This language barrier is not only because of the inability to speak English fluently. Many people who speak fluent English state that they&amp;nbsp;are not comfortable in medical consultations because medical jargons are not something they use in everyday conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing the need for a book to help the communication between doctors and patients, Dr Kam Cheong Wong has written a manuscript for a book titled &amp;ldquo;Improve Your Communication with Doctors&amp;rdquo;. The co-author, Catherine Wong, is a school teacher who has many years of teaching experience. Dr Wong has purposely chosen a non-medical background co-author to ensure the text is easily understood by the public so that they can communicate with their doctors effectively. The Chairman of the Australian Chinese Medical Association, Dr Stephen Li, has reviewed the manuscript and written a supportive Foreword for the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book gives patients important information to make it easier to communicate with their doctors under many different clinical circumstances. It can improve doctor-patient communication to bridge the missing link and to empower the patients to become &amp;lsquo;partners&amp;rsquo; with their doctors. Medical students, junior doctors (medical interns), and general practitioners/ family doctors can use this book to facilitate the communications with their patients. This book is not just meant for patients, it can be read by a layperson to improve his/her knowledge about common illnesses. Sample topics are included in the attached document.&lt;br /&gt;",

          "content": "Despite a National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development and the embodiment of this in numerous national and state statues, environmental degradation continues to occur on rural land. This raises the question of how the primary land managers in Queensland perceive sustainable development. Australia’s early reliance on agricultural production and international markets contributed substantially to the extensive environmental degradation that has occurred. Consequently economic and environmental issues have dominated the research on sustainable development, with the social dimension relatively neglected. In addition, despite the large quantity of work that has been conducted with farmers and graziers, little is known about how either of these types of land managers interpret sustainable development. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in-depth understanding of graziers’ perceptions of sustainable development to make a contribution to this area. An exploratory interpretative approach was taken to conduct this investigation because previous research had been limited. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted with 57 Queensland graziers in the tropical savannas in a case study with two locations – the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Central West. This approach was supported by participant observation and a brief questionnaire to provide background information. The fieldwork was conducted over a period of five months which allowed analysis to be conducted as the study progressed. Most of the graziers were interviewed on their properties with the goal of adding richness to the data and assisting with interpretation. Several bodies of literature have been used to interpret the results of this study. Areas of the sustainable development literature relevant to this thesis are reviewed to provide a context for the thesis. The literature on structural change in Australian agriculture provides a background to the broad influences on the agricultural sector and farmers. Also reviewed are the approaches taken to change the land management practices of farmers. The enduring value of farming and the changing values of rural land use are explored through a review of agrarianism, the goals and values of farmers and the post-productivist transition. The results for both study locations showed that these graziers preference the economic dimension of sustainable development over the environmental and social dimensions. The rationale for this preference is that maintaining economic viability will allow them to achieve their social goal – to continue their preferred way of life. A strong focus therefore, is on economic viability as a means to a social end. The objective is to overcome the constraints of being market and season dependent and the costs of operating in rural and remote locations through a whole-of-enterprise business management approach. The need for graziers to continue increasing their productivity to remain economically viable and to continue being competitive in international markets, challenges their ability to balance the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. For some the environmental dimension of sustainable development may be compromised to accommodate their economic priorities and social goals. A perceived future threat, more so for Gulf graziers, arises from the belief that they and their interests are marginalised through consultation processes. This contributes to their belief that the government prioritises Aboriginal land rights and environmental protection interests over their production interests. They believe that if this continues their future is at risk through further decreases to the security of their tenure. The results of this study suggest that a more innovative and integrated approach will be required to meet the challenges of sustainable development in these areas, in early twenty-first century Australia. The holistic approach from a social science perspective has provided an understanding of what graziers value and why. These insights contribute to knowledge of how to progress sustainable development. They could be tested with other types of land managers and as a foundation on which to build a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development.",

In addition, despite the large quantity of work that has been conducted with farmers and graziers, little is known about how either of these types of land managers interpret sustainable development. The aim of this thesis was to develop an in-depth understanding of graziers’ perceptions of sustainable development to make a contribution to this area. An exploratory interpretative approach was taken to conduct this investigation because previous research had been limited. In-depth unstructured interviews were conducted with 57 Queensland graziers in the tropical savannas in a case study with two locations – the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Central West. This approach was supported by participant observation and a brief questionnaire to provide background information. The fieldwork was conducted over a period of five months which allowed analysis to be conducted as the study progressed. Most of the graziers were interviewed on their properties with the goal of adding richness to the data and assisting with interpretation. Several bodies of literature have been used to interpret the results of this study. Areas of the sustainable development literature relevant to this thesis are reviewed to provide a context for the thesis. The literature on structural change in Australian agriculture provides a background to the broad influences on the agricultural sector and farmers. Also reviewed are the approaches taken to change the land management practices of farmers. The enduring value of farming and the changing values of rural land use are explored through a review of agrarianism, the goals and values of farmers and the post-productivist transition. The results for both study locations showed that these graziers preference the economic dimension of sustainable development over the environmental and social dimensions. The rationale for this preference is that maintaining economic viability will allow them to achieve their social goal – to continue their preferred way of life. A strong focus therefore, is on economic viability as a means to a social end. The objective is to overcome the constraints of being market and season dependent and the costs of operating in rural and remote locations through a whole-of-enterprise business management approach. The need for graziers to continue increasing their productivity to remain economically viable and to continue being competitive in international markets, challenges their ability to balance the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. For some the environmental dimension of sustainable development may be compromised to accommodate their economic priorities and social goals. A perceived future threat, more so for Gulf graziers, arises from the belief that they and their interests are marginalised through consultation processes. This contributes to their belief that the government prioritises Aboriginal land rights and environmental protection interests over their production interests. They believe that if this continues their future is at risk through further decreases to the security of their tenure. The results of this study suggest that a more innovative and integrated approach will be required to meet the challenges of sustainable development in these areas, in early twenty-first century Australia. The holistic approach from a social science perspective has provided an understanding of what graziers value and why. These insights contribute to knowledge of how to progress sustainable development. They could be tested with other types of land managers and as a foundation on which to build a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable development.",
